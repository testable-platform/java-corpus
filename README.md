# Testable Java corpus — JV_V14_MAVEN_WAR_MICRO

Grid cell `MVN-WAR-S` of the 24-cell Java grid.

## Project type

Order pricing and risk domain. The domain layer is byte-identical across all 24 branches
in this family, so any difference in tool output is attributable to the branch variables
below and not to the code the tool was pointed at.

## Branches

This repository holds 432 orphan branches, one per grid cell across every Java version, build system and packaging combination in this corpus. `main` carries the title
only. See `dataset.json` for the machine-readable description of this branch.

## Branch variables

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| Java version | 14 |
| Host JDK | 17 |
| Build system | Maven |
| Packaging | WAR |
| Architecture | Microservices |

## Supported tools

19 tools are wired on this branch (one `Tool Triggering (Synthetic Data)/<dir>/` folder
each). **14 of them run on JDK 14 (host JDK 17); 5 do not.**

That is the measurement, not a defect. A tool that cannot run exits **3**,
not 0 -- a skip that looks like a pass is the failure mode this corpus
exists to expose. Every `trigger.yaml` records the real, specific reason
when a tool can't run on this family.

### Running here

### Dark here

| Tool | Role | Block | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| `asm-defuse` | primary | Data Flow Testing | no jar published under a stable coordinate - place one in Tool Triggering (Synthetic Data)/asm-defuse/ |
| `ba-dua` | primary | All Definition Coverage | ba-dua 0.8.0 links JaCoCo 0.8.1, which stops at Java 10 class files |
| `custom-def-use` | n/a (placeholder) | Data Flow Testing | not a tool - the sheet names no package, version or vendor |
| `nullaway` | primary | All Definition Coverage | runs as an Error Prone compiler plugin, not a standalone step |
| `sonar` | primary | Coverage Delta | needs a running SonarQube server; set SONAR_HOST_URL to enable |

## Build

```
mvn -B clean package
```

Main and test sources both compile at Java 14 (bytecode major version 58), built by
`javac 17` with `--release 14`.

**Syntax is back.** Java 12 and Java 13 both contributed no final language syntax, because
their headline feature was held in preview through two cycles. That feature lands here:
**switch expressions became final in Java 14** (JEP 361), after preview in 12 (JEP 325) and
again in 13 (JEP 354). java14 closes the arc the two families before it opened, and it is
the first family since java11 to carry both kinds of lock at once:

| Lock | Kind | Where | Since |
|---|---|---|---|
| switch expressions, arrow rules, multiple case labels, `yield` | **parse-time** | `analysis/OrderClassifier.java` | 14 (final) |
| `java.io.Serial` | **attribution-time** | `model/PricingSnapshot.java` | 14 |

The distinction is measured, not asserted. `javac --release 13` reports only **three** errors
on the branch, all in `OrderClassifier` - *"switch expressions are not supported in
-source 13"*, *"switch rules..."*, *"multiple case labels..."* - because the parser stops
there and never reaches attribution. Delete that one file from a scratch copy and
`--release 13` reports **four more**, all `cannot find symbol: class Serial`. Seven locks
total, in two layers.

`@Serial` is a real API, not a decorative one: serialization's hook methods are matched by
name and signature at runtime with no interface to implement, so a misspelled `readObject`
silently does nothing. The annotation is what turns that into a compile error.

**Records, pattern matching for `instanceof` and text blocks are deliberately absent.** All
three were still preview in Java 14 - final in 16, 16 and 15 - so under the preview-off rule
they belong to later families, exactly as pattern-matching `switch` was held back from
java17 to java21.

Forward-checked as well as backward: the branch compiles clean at `--release 15, 16, 17, 21`
and `25`, so the cumulative ladder holds above it. That check entered the corpus after the
Java 13 family turned up `String.formatted` - an API that passes the backward check and then
disappears one release later.

Java 14 is **not an LTS release**. It shipped March 2020 and reached end of life in
September 2020, six months later. It is in this corpus to complete the version axis, not as
a recommendation.

## Tool test-data folders

Three sibling folders sit at the repo root, alongside this branch's own
`Tool Triggering (Synthetic Data)/` (above).

### `Tool Triggering (Tool Github Test data)/`
16 of this branch's 19 wired tools carry their own real upstream test suite
or source, pulled as-is from that tool's actual GitHub project -- not
generated: `CK/`, `Spoon/`, `JaCoCo/`, `PMD/`, `SpotBugs/`, `FindSecBugs/`,
`Checkstyle/`, `CPD/`, `PIT/`, `OWASP Dependency-Check/`, `Grype/`, `Lizard/`,
`ASM-DefUse/`, `ba-dua/`, `diff-cover/` and `pydriller/`. The remaining 3
wired tools have no folder here because there is no applicable upstream test
suite to pull: `git-churn` is just git's own log, not a packaged tool;
`nullaway` runs embedded as an Error Prone compiler plugin, not a standalone
artifact; and `sonar` needs a live SonarQube server rather than a static
test suite. (`custom-def-use` is the corpus's own deliberate non-tool
placeholder -- see the Supported tools table above -- so it was never a
candidate for this folder either.)

### `Tool Clean (Synthetic Data)/`
Most tools here carry 18 generated fixture packages, one per JDK family
(`java8` to `java25`), engineered to be clean so the tool should report
zero findings: the **Tool Clean (100% pass)** condition. This branch is
Java 14, so its own family is the `java14` folder inside each tool. Every
tool has a folder for every family, including families it cannot run
(those report not-installed or skipped, they are not left out). The real
tools were run on five of the families (8, 9, 16, 24, 25); the other
thirteen hold the same source, compiled and unit-tested at their own
`--release` only. The tools are `custom-def-use`, `git-churn`, `nullaway`
and `sonar` as well as the sixteen already there.

### `Tool Invalid (Synthetic Data)/`
Same shape as Clean -- the same 18 JDK-family folders -- but engineered so
every fixture makes the tool flag or fail rather than pass: the
**Tool Invalid** condition. `diff-cover`, `git-churn` and `pydriller` each carry one
real git repository's worth of history in both Clean and Invalid rather than 18
per-version copies, restored from `_git-bundles/` via `restore-git.ps1`
rather than kept as a live `.git` folder, so a plain file copy never
silently drops their content.

## Tool entry points

Each tool has `Tool Triggering (Synthetic Data)/<tool>/trigger.yaml` and `Tool Triggering (Synthetic Data)/<tool>/run.sh`. Runners follow the
exit-code contract: 0 ran, 1 failed, 3 skipped-cannot-run, 4 not-installed.

## Planted CVE pins

| Dependency | Version |
|---|---|
| `commons-collections:commons-collections` | 3.2.1 |
| `org.apache.commons:commons-text` | 1.9 |
| `com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` | 2.9.10.1 |
| `log4j:log4j` | 1.2.17 |
| `org.yaml:snakeyaml` | 1.30 |

Deliberately vulnerable versions, so the SCA metrics have known true positives. Do not
upgrade them.

<!-- tools-non-triggering -->
## Tools non triggering (Synthetic Data)

A fifth per-branch data folder, beside `Tool Clean (Synthetic Data)`,
`Tool Invalid (Synthetic Data)`, `Tool Triggering (Synthetic Data)` and
`Tool Triggering (Tool Github Test data)`.

Clean makes each tool run and report nothing wrong. Invalid makes it run and
report something. This folder holds data with nothing in it for any tool to
catch -- and, where no program would reach the tool at all, nothing for it to
start on. It is the negative control that tells *correctly detected nothing*
apart from *the scan never ran*.

`Tools non triggering (Synthetic Data)/` holds 20 tool-named folders, matching the names in Clean
and Invalid so the data sets line up name-for-name:

* **8 tools read source**, so they get a minimal program per boundary
  family (java8 .. java25 (all 18)) -- one class or one function, no branching, no
  duplication, no dependency, no dead export, no magic number.
* **12 tools cannot be answered by a program** -- they read a lockfile,
  a coverage report, compiled bytecode or the commit history -- so they carry
  the subject matter as a plain record instead, with the reason stated in that
  folder's own README.

**No manifest, no lockfile, no tool configuration, no runner and no
`trigger.yaml` anywhere in it**, so the folder adds no discovered project and
no task to a run.

See `Tools non triggering (Synthetic Data)/README.md` for the per-tool table, the mechanism each tool is
inert by, and what was measured.
