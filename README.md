# Testable Java corpus — JV_V22_ANTIVY_SHADEDUBERJARRELOCATED_MICRO

Grid cell `ANT-SHADE-S` of the 24-cell Java grid.

## Project type

Order pricing and risk domain. The domain layer is byte-identical across all 24 branches
in this family, so any difference in tool output is attributable to the branch variables
below and not to the code the tool was pointed at.

## Branches

This repository holds 432 orphan branches, one per grid cell across every Java version, build system and packaging combination in this corpus. `main` carries the title
only. See `dataset.json` for the machine-readable description of this branch.

## Branch variables

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| Java version | 22 |
| Host JDK | 25 |
| Build system | Ant + Ivy |
| Packaging | Shaded uber-jar (relocated) |
| Architecture | Microservices |

## Supported tools

19 tools are wired on this branch (one `Tool Triggering (Synthetic Data)/<dir>/` folder
each). **13 of them run on JDK 22 (host JDK 25); 6 do not.**

That is the measurement, not a defect. A tool that cannot run exits **3**,
not 0 -- a skip that looks like a pass is the failure mode this corpus
exists to expose. Every `trigger.yaml` records the real, specific reason
when a tool can't run on this family.

### Running here

| Tool | Role | Block |
|---|---|---|
| `checkstyle` | primary | Lint / Rule Violations |
| `cpd` | primary | Code Duplication |
| `diff-cover` | primary | Coverage Delta |
| `git-churn` | primary | Code Churn |
| `grype` | alternative | Dependency Risk (SCA) |
| `jacoco` | primary | Statement / Branch / Path Coverage |
| `lizard` | alternative | Cyclomatic Complexity |
| `owasp-dependency-check` | primary | Dependency Risk (SCA) |
| `pit` | primary | Mutation Score |
| `pmd` | primary | Cognitive Complexity |
| `pydriller` | alternative | Code Churn |
| `spoon` | primary | Data Flow Testing |
| `spotbugs` | primary | Static Vulnerabilities (SAST) |

### Dark here

| Tool | Role | Block | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| `asm-defuse` | primary | Data Flow Testing | no jar published under a stable coordinate - place one in Tool Triggering (Synthetic Data)/asm-defuse/ |
| `ba-dua` | primary | All Definition Coverage | ba-dua 0.8.0 links JaCoCo 0.8.1, which stops at Java 10 class files |
| `ck` | primary | Cyclomatic Complexity | CK 0.7.0 bundles Eclipse JDT 3.26.0, which parses only up to Java 16 - it cannot read this branch's records or sealed types |
| `custom-def-use` | n/a (placeholder) | Data Flow Testing | not a tool - the sheet names no package, version or vendor |
| `nullaway` | primary | All Definition Coverage | runs as an Error Prone compiler plugin, not a standalone step |
| `sonar` | primary | Coverage Delta | needs a running SonarQube server; set SONAR_HOST_URL to enable |

## Build

```
ant clean package
```

Main and test sources both compile at Java 22 (bytecode major version 66), built by
`javac 25` with `--release 22`.

**Syntax returns after three empty releases.** java18, java19 and java20 contributed no final
language features at all. Java 22 ends that, and because this family sits directly above
java20 in the cumulative ladder, it carries **Java 21's** locks as well as its own - four lock
files, one kind of lock each:

| File | Lock | Kind | Since |
|---|---|---|---|
| `analysis/EventNarrator.java` | pattern matching for `switch`, record patterns, guards, `case null` | parse-time | **21** |
| `analysis/RouteLog.java` | sequenced collections (`getFirst`/`getLast`/`reversed`, `SequencedSet`, `SequencedMap`) | attribution-time | **21** |
| `analysis/LegAuditor.java` | unnamed variables and unnamed patterns (`_`) | parse-time | 22 |
| `util/NativeMetrics.java` | Foreign Function and Memory API | attribution-time | 22 |

Measured in both directions. At `--release 21` the Java 22 locks fire: 1 error in `LegAuditor`
(*"unnamed variables are not supported in -source 21"*) and 13 in `NativeMetrics`. At
`--release 20` the inherited Java 21 locks fire as well: 2 in `EventNarrator`
(*"patterns in switch statements are not supported in -source 20"*) and 14 in `RouteLog`.

### Two features that show what the preview rule was protecting

**Pattern matching for `switch` was previewed in 17, 18, 19 and 20** - four rounds - before
going final in 21. It is the longest preview run of any language feature in this corpus, and
it is single-handedly why java18, java19 and java20 are API-only families.

**The Foreign Function and Memory API took even longer**: incubator in 17, 18, 19 and 20,
preview in 21 and 22, final in Java 22. Six releases from first incubator to final. What it
replaces is worth stating, because it is why the wait mattered: before it, off-heap memory
meant either `ByteBuffer.allocateDirect`, whose lifetime is decided by the garbage collector
rather than by the caller and which is capped at `Integer.MAX_VALUE` bytes, or
`sun.misc.Unsafe`, which is neither safe nor supported. An `Arena` closes deterministically,
and a confined arena additionally enforces single-thread access, so use-after-free and
cross-thread access become exceptions instead of undefined behaviour. `NativeMetrics`
exercises exactly that: the test closes the arena and asserts that the next read throws.

### A diagnostic worth noticing

At `--release 21`, FFM does not fail with *"cannot find symbol"* - it fails with **"Arena is a
preview API and is disabled by default"**. The type exists in Java 21's API surface; it is the
preview status that stops it. That is the same shape as `String.formatted` at `--release 14`
(recorded under java13) and `ScopedValue` at `--release 21` (recorded under java25). Three
independent instances now: **a version lock can be a policy error rather than a missing
symbol**, and a gate that only greps for "cannot find symbol" would miss all three.

### Unnamed patterns change what can be expressed, not only how it reads

`LegAuditor.skuOf` destructures one component out of a four-component nested record. Before
Java 22 a record pattern had to bind *every* component, so reading one field meant naming
three variables the compiler would then warn were unused. `_` is enforced, not cosmetic:
referring to it is an error, and two `_` in one scope are legal where two identical names are
not.

Forward-checked at `--release 25`: clean.

Java 22 is **not an LTS release**. It shipped March 2024 and reached end of life in September
2024, six months later. It is in this corpus to complete the version axis, not as
a recommendation.

## Tool test-data folders

Three sibling folders sit at the repo root, alongside this branch's own
`Tool Triggering (Synthetic Data)/` (above).

### `Tool Triggering (Tool Github Test data)/`
16 of this branch's 19 wired tools carry their own real upstream test suite
or source, pulled as-is from that tool's actual GitHub project -- not
generated: `CK/`, `Spoon/`, `JaCoCo/`, `PMD/`, `SpotBugs/`, `FindSecBugs/`,
`Checkstyle/`, `CPD/`, `PIT/`, `OWASP Dependency-Check/`, `Grype/`, `Lizard/`,
`ASM-DefUse/`, `ba-dua/`, `diff-cover/` and `pydriller/`. The remaining 3
wired tools have no folder here because there is no applicable upstream test
suite to pull: `git-churn` is just git's own log, not a packaged tool;
`nullaway` runs embedded as an Error Prone compiler plugin, not a standalone
artifact; and `sonar` needs a live SonarQube server rather than a static
test suite. (`custom-def-use` is the corpus's own deliberate non-tool
placeholder -- see the Supported tools table above -- so it was never a
candidate for this folder either.)

### `Tool Clean (Synthetic Data)/`
Most tools here carry 18 generated fixture packages, one per JDK family
(`java8` to `java25`), engineered to be clean so the tool should report
zero findings: the **Tool Clean (100% pass)** condition. This branch is
Java 22, so its own family is the `java22` folder inside each tool. Every
tool has a folder for every family, including families it cannot run
(those report not-installed or skipped, they are not left out). The real
tools were run on five of the families (8, 9, 16, 24, 25); the other
thirteen hold the same source, compiled and unit-tested at their own
`--release` only. The tools are `custom-def-use`, `git-churn`, `nullaway`
and `sonar` as well as the sixteen already there.

### `Tool Invalid (Synthetic Data)/`
Same shape as Clean -- the same 18 JDK-family folders -- but engineered so
every fixture makes the tool flag or fail rather than pass: the
**Tool Invalid** condition. `diff-cover`, `git-churn` and `pydriller` each carry one
real git repository's worth of history in both Clean and Invalid rather than 18
per-version copies, restored from `_git-bundles/` via `restore-git.ps1`
rather than kept as a live `.git` folder, so a plain file copy never
silently drops their content.

## Tool entry points

Each tool has `Tool Triggering (Synthetic Data)/<tool>/trigger.yaml` and `Tool Triggering (Synthetic Data)/<tool>/run.sh`. Runners follow the
exit-code contract: 0 ran, 1 failed, 3 skipped-cannot-run, 4 not-installed.

## Planted CVE pins

| Dependency | Version |
|---|---|
| `commons-collections:commons-collections` | 3.2.1 |
| `org.apache.commons:commons-text` | 1.9 |
| `com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` | 2.9.10.1 |
| `log4j:log4j` | 1.2.17 |
| `org.yaml:snakeyaml` | 1.30 |

Deliberately vulnerable versions, so the SCA metrics have known true positives. Do not
upgrade them.
