# Testable Java corpus — JV_V12_GRADLEKOTLINDSL_WAR_MICRO

Grid cell `GRK-WAR-S` of the 24-cell Java grid.

## Project type

Order pricing and risk domain. The domain layer is byte-identical across all 24 branches
in this family, so any difference in tool output is attributable to the branch variables
below and not to the code the tool was pointed at.

## Branches

This repository holds 432 orphan branches, one per grid cell across every Java version, build system and packaging combination in this corpus. `main` carries the title
only. See `dataset.json` for the machine-readable description of this branch.

## Branch variables

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| Java version | 12 |
| Host JDK | 17 |
| Build system | Gradle / Kotlin DSL |
| Packaging | WAR |
| Architecture | Microservices |

## Supported tools

19 tools are wired on this branch (one `Tool Triggering (Synthetic Data)/<dir>/` folder
each). **14 of them run on JDK 12 (host JDK 17); 5 do not.**

That is the measurement, not a defect. A tool that cannot run exits **3**,
not 0 -- a skip that looks like a pass is the failure mode this corpus
exists to expose. Every `trigger.yaml` records the real, specific reason
when a tool can't run on this family.

### Running here

| Tool | Role | Block |
|---|---|---|
| `checkstyle` | primary | Lint / Rule Violations |
| `ck` | primary | Cyclomatic Complexity |
| `cpd` | primary | Code Duplication |
| `diff-cover` | primary | Coverage Delta |
| `git-churn` | primary | Code Churn |
| `grype` | alternative | Dependency Risk (SCA) |
| `jacoco` | primary | Statement / Branch / Path Coverage |
| `lizard` | alternative | Cyclomatic Complexity |
| `owasp-dependency-check` | primary | Dependency Risk (SCA) |
| `pit` | primary | Mutation Score |
| `pmd` | primary | Cognitive Complexity |
| `pydriller` | alternative | Code Churn |
| `spoon` | primary | Data Flow Testing |
| `spotbugs` | primary | Static Vulnerabilities (SAST) |

### Dark here

| Tool | Role | Block | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| `asm-defuse` | primary | Data Flow Testing | no jar published under a stable coordinate - place one in Tool Triggering (Synthetic Data)/asm-defuse/ |
| `ba-dua` | primary | All Definition Coverage | ba-dua 0.8.0 links JaCoCo 0.8.1, which stops at Java 10 class files |
| `custom-def-use` | n/a (placeholder) | Data Flow Testing | not a tool - the sheet names no package, version or vendor |
| `nullaway` | primary | All Definition Coverage | runs as an Error Prone compiler plugin, not a standalone step |
| `sonar` | primary | Coverage Delta | needs a running SonarQube server; set SONAR_HOST_URL to enable |

## Build

```
./gradlew build
```

Main and test sources both compile at Java 12 (bytecode major version 56), built by
`javac 17` with `--release 12`.

**The Java 12 lock is an API lock, not a syntax lock.** Java 12's headline language change
was switch expressions, and they were a *preview* feature in 12 — they did not become final
until Java 14. The corpus rule is that preview features stay off, so there is no
Java-12-final syntax to lock against. `analysis/OrderDigest.java` carries the lock through
four APIs that first shipped in Java 12 instead:

| API | Added |
|---|---|
| `Collectors.teeing` | Java 12 |
| `String.transform` | Java 12 |
| `String.indent` | Java 12 |
| `NumberFormat.getCompactNumberInstance` / `CompactNumberFormat` | Java 12 |

The file fails to compile under `--release 11` in five places, and the Java 17 family's own
lock files still fail under `--release 12` (`sealed classes are not supported in
-source 12`, `text blocks are not supported in -source 12`, `switch expressions are not
supported in -source 12`). The differentiation holds in both directions — it is real, not
declared.

Java 12 is **not an LTS release**. It shipped March 2019 and reached end of life in
September 2019, six months later. It is in this corpus to complete the version axis, not
as a recommendation.

## Tool test-data folders

Three sibling folders sit at the repo root, alongside this branch's own
`Tool Triggering (Synthetic Data)/` (above).

### `Tool Triggering (Tool Github Test data)/`
16 of this branch's 19 wired tools carry their own real upstream test suite
or source, pulled as-is from that tool's actual GitHub project -- not
generated: `CK/`, `Spoon/`, `JaCoCo/`, `PMD/`, `SpotBugs/`, `FindSecBugs/`,
`Checkstyle/`, `CPD/`, `PIT/`, `OWASP Dependency-Check/`, `Grype/`, `Lizard/`,
`ASM-DefUse/`, `ba-dua/`, `diff-cover/` and `pydriller/`. The remaining 3
wired tools have no folder here because there is no applicable upstream test
suite to pull: `git-churn` is just git's own log, not a packaged tool;
`nullaway` runs embedded as an Error Prone compiler plugin, not a standalone
artifact; and `sonar` needs a live SonarQube server rather than a static
test suite. (`custom-def-use` is the corpus's own deliberate non-tool
placeholder -- see the Supported tools table above -- so it was never a
candidate for this folder either.)

### `Tool Clean (Synthetic Data)/`
Most tools here carry 18 generated fixture packages, one per JDK family
(`java8` to `java25`), engineered to be clean so the tool should report
zero findings: the **Tool Clean (100% pass)** condition. This branch is
Java 12, so its own family is the `java12` folder inside each tool. Every
tool has a folder for every family, including families it cannot run
(those report not-installed or skipped, they are not left out). The real
tools were run on five of the families (8, 9, 16, 24, 25); the other
thirteen hold the same source, compiled and unit-tested at their own
`--release` only. The tools are `custom-def-use`, `git-churn`, `nullaway`
and `sonar` as well as the sixteen already there.

### `Tool Invalid (Synthetic Data)/`
Same shape as Clean -- the same 18 JDK-family folders -- but engineered so
every fixture makes the tool flag or fail rather than pass: the
**Tool Invalid** condition. `diff-cover`, `git-churn` and `pydriller` each carry one
real git repository's worth of history in both Clean and Invalid rather than 18
per-version copies, restored from `_git-bundles/` via `restore-git.ps1`
rather than kept as a live `.git` folder, so a plain file copy never
silently drops their content.

## Tool entry points

Each tool has `Tool Triggering (Synthetic Data)/<tool>/trigger.yaml` and `Tool Triggering (Synthetic Data)/<tool>/run.sh`. Runners follow the
exit-code contract: 0 ran, 1 failed, 3 skipped-cannot-run, 4 not-installed.

## Planted CVE pins

| Dependency | Version |
|---|---|
| `commons-collections:commons-collections` | 3.2.1 |
| `org.apache.commons:commons-text` | 1.9 |
| `com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` | 2.9.10.1 |
| `log4j:log4j` | 1.2.17 |
| `org.yaml:snakeyaml` | 1.30 |

Deliberately vulnerable versions, so the SCA metrics have known true positives. Do not
upgrade them.
