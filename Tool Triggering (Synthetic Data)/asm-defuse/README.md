The third option named in the sheet's Data Flow prose. Builds def-use chains from
bytecode via the ASM analysis library, so its Java-version ceiling is whatever ASM
version it links.

Not published to Maven Central under a stable coordinate; the runner exits 4
(not-installed) until a jar is placed here. Documented rather than silently omitted.
