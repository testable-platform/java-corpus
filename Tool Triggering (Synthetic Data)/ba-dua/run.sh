# This tool is named by the metric roster but cannot run on this branch:
#   ba-dua 0.8.0 links JaCoCo 0.8.1, which stops at Java 10 class files
#
# It ships anyway, exiting 3, so the metrics that name it are visibly accounted for
# rather than silently missing. See Tool Triggering (Synthetic Data)/ba-dua/README.md.
