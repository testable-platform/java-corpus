# This tool is named by the metric roster but cannot run on this branch:
#   CK 0.7.0 bundles Eclipse JDT 3.26.0, which parses only up to Java 16 - it cannot read this branch's records or sealed types
#
# It ships anyway, exiting 3, so the metrics that name it are visibly accounted for
# rather than silently missing. See Tool Triggering (Synthetic Data)/ck/README.md.
