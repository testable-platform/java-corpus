# Java-Tools-Clean

A folder of 20 tool-named projects, mirroring the folder names in the
harvested `Java Tools` directory (each of which holds that tool's own
real upstream test suite). This corpus is the opposite of that: each
folder is a small **synthetic** project, engineered so that the tool it
is named after finds **nothing wrong** -- the same negative-control
methodology already used for the sibling `Python-Tools-Clean` and
`JavaScript-Tools-Clean` corpora.

A family where nothing ever fires cannot tell "correctly detected
nothing" apart from "the scan never ran." A clean baseline is what makes
a zero legible: every result below was produced by actually installing
(or, where genuinely unreachable, honestly recording as absent) and
invoking the real tool, not by assertion. "Declared support is a claim;
invoking is the fact."

## Boundary-version structure

17 of the 20 tools are exploded into per-tool subfolders, one per JDK
family (`java8` to `java25`, 18 each; the five boundary families below are
the ones the real tools were run on), mirroring `Python-Tools-Clean`'s `py3.X/` and
`JavaScript-Tools-Clean`'s `nodeXX/` pattern:

| Family | Role | How it's verified |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `java8` | earliest | **live** -- compiled with JDK 8 (native), the real installed tool run for real |
| `java9` | earliest+1 | **live** -- compiled with `javac --release 9` under a JDK 11 host, the real tool run for real |
| `java16` | middle | **live** -- compiled with `javac --release 16` under a JDK 17 host, the real tool run for real |
| `java24` | latest-1 | **live** -- compiled with `javac --release 24` under a JDK 25 host, the real tool run for real |
| `java25` | latest | **live** -- compiled with JDK 25 (native), the real tool run for real |

Unlike the sibling Python/JavaScript corpora, **no family here is
code-only.** Those corpora needed a code-only tier because their
earliest interpreter/runtime versions genuinely could not execute a
modern release of the tool being tested. That problem doesn't arise for
Java: every boundary JDK from 8 to 25 can run Checkstyle 8.36.1, Lizard,
jscpd and semgrep identically (they only read source text), and the real
failure mode here shows up at the *opposite* end of the range instead --
see Genuine findings below.

`openjdk-8-jdk` and `openjdk-25-jdk` are Ubuntu 24.04's own apt packages
(both LTS releases); `openjdk-9-jdk`, `openjdk-16-jdk` and
`openjdk-24-jdk` have **no apt package at all** (confirmed directly:
`apt-cache policy` returns nothing for all three -- only the LTS releases
8/11/17/21/25 are packaged). Each of those three families is therefore
produced by cross-compiling with `javac --release N` under the next
newest already-installed LTS JDK as host -- exactly the pattern the
platform's own `java-repos-build-contract.md` documents for its much
larger sibling corpus. Verified directly: `--release 9` under JDK 11
produces a real class file major version 53; `--release 16` under JDK 17
produces major 60; `--release 24` under JDK 25 produces major 68 --
exactly the values the JVM spec assigns those releases.

The domain source uses no version-gated Java syntax (no `var`, records,
sealed types, or pattern matching), so the same `.java` files compile
unchanged at every one of the five targets -- only the compiler
invocation (host JDK + `--release` flag) differs per family, mirroring
the "same domain source, unmodified, across all families" rule already
used in the sibling corpora.

The remaining 3 tools -- **diff-cover, git-churn, pydriller** -- are git-history/
coverage-diff tools and stay single-version and unversioned, exactly
like Python's and JavaScript's diff-cover/pydriller pair, since what they
measure is commit history and a coverage report, not JDK compatibility.

## Measured results (the 14 original versioned tools x the 5 boundary families = 70 cells)

| Tool | java8 | java9 | java16 | java24 | java25 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ASM-DefUse | CLEAN | CLEAN | CLEAN | **FINDING** | **FINDING** |
| CK | NOT INSTALLED | NOT INSTALLED | NOT INSTALLED | NOT INSTALLED | NOT INSTALLED |
| CPD (jscpd stand-in) | CLEAN | CLEAN | CLEAN | CLEAN | CLEAN |
| Checkstyle | CLEAN | CLEAN | CLEAN | CLEAN | CLEAN |
| FindSecBugs (semgrep stand-in) | CLEAN | CLEAN | CLEAN | CLEAN | CLEAN |
| Grype | NOT INSTALLED | NOT INSTALLED | NOT INSTALLED | NOT INSTALLED | NOT INSTALLED |
| JaCoCo | CLEAN | CLEAN | CLEAN | **FINDING** | **FINDING** |
| Lizard | CLEAN | CLEAN | CLEAN | CLEAN | CLEAN |
| OWASP Dependency-Check | NOT INSTALLED | NOT INSTALLED | NOT INSTALLED | NOT INSTALLED | NOT INSTALLED |
| PIT | NOT INSTALLED | NOT INSTALLED | NOT INSTALLED | NOT INSTALLED | NOT INSTALLED |
| PMD | NOT INSTALLED | NOT INSTALLED | NOT INSTALLED | NOT INSTALLED | NOT INSTALLED |
| Spoon | NOT INSTALLED | NOT INSTALLED | NOT INSTALLED | NOT INSTALLED | NOT INSTALLED |
| SpotBugs | NOT INSTALLED | NOT INSTALLED | NOT INSTALLED | NOT INSTALLED | NOT INSTALLED |
| ba-dua | NOT INSTALLED | NOT INSTALLED | NOT INSTALLED | NOT INSTALLED | NOT INSTALLED |

**Tally: 26 CLEAN, 4 FINDING, 40 NOT INSTALLED.**

Plus the 2 original unversioned tools, both CLEAN (git-churn is in the section on added tools below):

| Tool | Result | Command |
| --- | --- | --- |
| diff-cover | CLEAN | `diff-cover coverage.xml --compare-branch main` |
| pydriller | CLEAN | `python3 -c "from pydriller import Repository; ..."` |

**NOT INSTALLED** (CK, Grype, OWASP Dependency-Check, PIT, PMD, Spoon,
SpotBugs, ba-dua -- unchanged from the original single-version build,
across every family): this sandbox's egress proxy refuses Maven Central,
the Gradle Plugin Portal, GitHub Release downloads, and the Go module
proxy -- confirmed by direct measurement, not assumed. That blocking is
the same regardless of which JDK compiles the domain source, so these 8
tools show the identical result in all 5 families; see each tool's own
README for the exact reason and what was checked.

The exit-code vocabulary throughout this corpus never collapses 1
(findings), 3 (skipped), and 4 (not installed) into the same result -- a
missing binary must never masquerade as a clean scan, and neither must
"this family can't run it."

## Genuine findings (not papered over)

**ASM-DefUse / java24, java25** and **JaCoCo / java24, java25** -- both
tools depend, directly or (for JaCoCo, via Debian's unbundled packaging)
indirectly, on the apt-installed `libasm-java` 9.7. Verified directly:
ASM 9.7's `ClassReader` throws `IllegalArgumentException: Unsupported
class file major version 68` (java24) and `...69` (java25) -- it simply
does not parse Java 24/25 bytecode. ASM 9.8, which adds that support, is
not reachable here (Maven Central, where it would come from, is blocked
at the egress proxy). Confirmed two independent ways for JaCoCo: via its
in-process `Instrumenter` API and via the real `-javaagent` runtime jar
attached to a live JVM -- both fail identically. No upgrade path exists
today; this is left as a genuine, reproducible, documented incompatibility
rather than patched around. Every other cell for both tools (java8,
java9, java16) is independently measured CLEAN: the same real
`DefUseRunner`/`JacocoRunner` drivers, run against that family's own
really-compiled bytecode, actually produce
`ORPHAN_DEFINITIONS=0`/`100.00%` coverage.

Both findings are baked into the generator (`family_table.py`'s
`FINDINGS`, consumed by `verify_live.py` and the README writers), not
just hand-noted -- rerunning `verify_live.py` reproduces them.

## Added later: 13 more JDK families and 4 more tools

Two gaps were closed after the original measurement above.

**Every tool now has a folder for every JDK family.** The 14 versioned tools above (and the three new versioned tools below) carry `java8` to `java25`, 18 folders each, so a branch's own family is always present (Java 11 -> `java11`, Java 17 -> `java17`, and so on). The 13 added families are `java10` to `java15` and `java17` to `java23`. Their source is the same file, byte for byte, as `java8` (identical git blob hashes -- nothing is version-gated); each was compiled with `javac --release N` on a JDK 25 host and its unit tests run. **The real tools were not re-run on these 13 families**, so they have no row in the measured tables above, and a tool that cannot run a family still has the folder.

**Four tools that had no folder here now do**: `custom-def-use`, `git-churn`, `nullaway` and `sonar`.

| Tool | Versioned | Result | What was run |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| custom-def-use | 18 families | CLEAN on java8..java23, ASM ceiling on java24..java25 | the sibling ASM-DefUse library on each family's class files (see its README) |
| git-churn | no (git history) | CLEAN | `git log --numstat` over a real 5-commit history |
| nullaway | 18 families | NOT INSTALLED | Error Prone plugin; Maven Central is blocked here |
| sonar | 18 families | NOT INSTALLED | needs a SonarQube server and scanner, neither reachable here |

For `nullaway` and `sonar` the README of each folder lists the defects that were planted (Invalid) or avoided (Clean) from reading the source; none of that was measured by the tools themselves.

## Rules every folder obeys

- No dependency on any other folder in this corpus -- each is its own Java project (or, for diff-cover/pydriller, its own real invocation of an external CLI).
- Pure ASCII throughout -- verified corpus-wide, 0 non-ASCII bytes in any file.
- 0 code clones corpus-wide (verified with jscpd, `--min-lines 5 --min-tokens 30 --threshold 0`, Java files): every folder's domain, vocabulary, and control-flow shape is deliberately distinct from every other folder's.
- Real git history (3 synthetic authors, real commits) for the three tools that mine history (git-churn is described in the section on added tools): diff-cover (plus a real feature-branch diff) and pydriller.
- Same domain source, unmodified, across all five families of a given tool -- only the compiling JDK and `--release` flag differ per family.
- No fabricated tool results. Where a named tool could not be run at all, the folder says so and, where a real adjacent tool could stand in (CPD -> jscpd, FindSecBugs -> semgrep), that stand-in was actually run in every family and its real result reported -- never presented as the named tool's own output.

## Layout

```text
<Tool Name>/
  README.md              what clean means for this tool, the per-family results
  java8/ ... java25/     one folder per JDK family (18), each with its own src/main + src/test copy;
                         the original five (8, 9, 16, 24, 25) were run live, the other 13 are compile-checked only
  tools/                 shared driver, only where the tool needs one (JaCoCo, ASM-DefUse) -- compiled once, family-independent
  vendor/                only where a dependency was built from source (ASM-DefUse) -- shared, family-independent
  security-rules.yml     FindSecBugs's local semgrep ruleset -- shared, family-independent
  .git/                  only where the tool mines real history (diff-cover, git-churn, pydriller) -- unversioned, untouched
_generator/               family_table.py, generate.py, verify_live.py, write_tool_readmes.py, write_family_readmes.py, write_new_root_readme.py, meta.py, verify.py (original single-version tally)
```

## Reproducing

```bash
python3 _generator/write_tool_readmes.py     # regenerate the 13 auto-written base per-folder READMEs from meta.py
python3 _generator/generate.py               # explode each versionable tool into java8/9/16/24/25
python3 _generator/verify_live.py            # real compile + real tool run for every live tool, every family
python3 _generator/write_family_readmes.py   # append the per-family results section to each tool's README
python3 _generator/write_new_root_readme.py  # regenerate this file
```

`generate.py` and `verify_live.py` read `family_table.py` for the host-JDK/
`--release` mapping per family (including the `FINDINGS` documented
above) and need JDK 8, 11, 17, 21 and 25 on this host (`apt install
openjdk-8-jdk openjdk-11-jdk openjdk-17-jdk openjdk-25-jdk`; JDK 21 was
already present). `Checkstyle`/`Lizard`/`CPD`(jscpd)/`FindSecBugs`(semgrep)
need the same apt/pip/npm packages as the original single-version build.

The generator scripts above cover only the original 16 tools and the five boundary families. The 13 added families, the 4 added tools were done afterwards by the Java corpus fix and are not reproduced by `_generator/`.
